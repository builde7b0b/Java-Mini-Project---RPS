# Java-Mini-Project---RPS


## Description
This is a Java implementation of the classic game "rock-paper-scissors". The game has a main menu with options to enter two players or play against the computer. When playing against another human, players can take turns playing rock, paper, or scissors. When playing against the computer, the computer will randomly choose its move. The winner of each round is determined according to the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The game continues until a player reaches a specified number of points, at which point the winner is declared.
